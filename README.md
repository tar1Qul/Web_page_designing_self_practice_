# Web Page Designing Self Practice

This repository is for building my portfolio.  
Here is a web page that I designed by observing a design made in Figma.  
I built this with **HTML & CSS**. This page was created for self-practice.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

1. **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**  
   Used for structuring the webpage.

   I've included common semantic tags like:
   - `<div>`
   - `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.

2. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**  
   Used for styling:
   - Flexbox layout (`display: flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`)
   - `background-image`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, `linear-gradient(...)`
   - Custom buttons and hover effects
   - Fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
   - Media queries for responsive design (mobile, tablet, laptop)

3. **Font Awesome Icons**  
   Included via CDN:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.0/css/all.min.css">
