Thia ripository is for building my portfolio. Here is I web page which I designed by observing a page which was designed by figma and designed this with HTML&CSS.
I designed this page for self practice.



Here I used below mentioned Technologies 

1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
Used for structuring your webpage.

I’ve included common semantic tags like:
<div>, <h1> to <h4>, <p>, <button>, <img>, <section>, <footer>, <a>, etc.

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
Used for styling your page.

I’ve used:
Custom classes and IDs for layout and design.
Flexbox for layout: display: flex;, justify-content, align-items, etc.
background-image, border-radius, box-shadow, etc.
Gradients: linear-gradient(...)
Custom buttons and hover styles.
Fonts from Google Fonts (Plus Jakarta Sans).
Responsive design using Media Queries:
For laptops, tablets, and mobile devices (max-width values).

3. Font Awesome Icons
You’ve included Font Awesome via CDN:

html
Copy
Edit
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/...">
Used for social icons like:

<i class="fab fa-facebook"></i>

<i class="fab fa-instagram"></i>, etc.
